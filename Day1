# Day-1 Task

1.Comments- # is used to create comments.

2.Python I/O- Python has inbuilt functions for input and output, input() for taking inputs and print() for output.

s=input(‘Enter your statement:’)
Enter your statement: Hello, my name is Aaryaman
print('Hello, my name is Aaryaman')- Hello, my name is Aaryaman

a=12
print('The value of a is' ,a)- The value of a is 12

a=input(‘Enter a value:’)
b=input(‘Enter a value:’)
Enter a value: 10
Enter a value: 20
print('The value of x is {} and y is {}'.format(x,y))- The value of x is 10 and y is 20

print('i like to {0} and {1}.format('play','dance'))- i like to play and dance
print('i like to {1} and {0}.format('play','dance'))- i like to dance and play

print(10,20,30,40, sep='*')- 10*20*30*40


3.Operators- Python has various type of operators mainly arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical etc. 

print(10+5) - 15 - Arithmetic 
x=10  - Assignment 
x+=3 - Short hand operator
x>=y - Comparison operator
x<5 and y>10 - Logical operator


4.Namespace- It is a form of python dictionary that has unique name for each and every object in python.

v1=5                    //global namespace
def func1():
  v2=6                 //local namespace
  def func2():
v3=7              //nested local namespace


def f()
print('Start f()') 
def g()
print('Start g()') 
print('End g()') 
return 
g()
print('End f()')
return 
f()


5.Some useful functions- Python has many inbuilt and user-defined function to work on. Some of them are as follows-

a=’Hello my name is Aaryaman’
a.upper()  -  HELLO MY NAME IS AARYAMAN

abs(-4/3) - 1.333

min(2,3,5) - 2

a=[3,2,1]
a.sorted() - 1,2,3

sum(a) - 6

6.Flow control statement- In python we use variety of statements for execution of the statements and checking the conditions. Some of them are-

n=10
if n%2==0:
  print(‘n is even’)

n=5
if n%2==0:
  print(‘n is even’)
else:
  print(‘n is odd’)

l=[1,2,3,4,5]
for I in range(len(l)):
   print(l[i])

m=5
i=0

while(i<m):
  print(i)
  i=i+1


7.Python data types- Just like any other data type python has some data types too but we don’t need to declare them explicitly but the compiler detects the type by itself.

Text type- str
Numeric type- int, float, complex
Sequence type- list, tuple 

8.List- These are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are ordered and can contain duplicate elements.

L=[“apple”,”banana”,”lichi”]
L1=[1,2,3,4,5]

for i in range(len(L)):
  print(L[i])

for i in range(len(L1)):
  print(L1[i])

9.Tuple- These are used to store multiple values in a single variable. The values once stored in tuple are unchangeable, can have duplicated and ordered.

L=(“apple”,”banana”,”lichi”)
L1=(1,2,3,4,5)
L2=(True, False, True)
L3=(“apple”,30,”banana”,40,”lichi”,50)

10.Dictionary- These are used to store the value in key value pair. This is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

print(thisdict["brand"])- Ford

print(thisdict) - {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}

11.Strings- Strings are used in python enclosed in single or double quotes.

a = "Hello"
print(a)

a = """hello my name is Aaryaman.
I study in Thapar Institute.
I live in Punjab."""
print(a)


a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1]) - e

for x in "banana":
  print(x) 
b
a
n
a
n
a

a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a)) - 13
